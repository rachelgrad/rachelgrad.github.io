			Step 1: Look At The Sender Address
		</div>

		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p>Look closely at the second part of the sender's email address, after the @. It may be misspelled or even nonsense. Legitimate organizations will never send from common email providers like @gmail.com (not even Google!). It may include convincing text like "payhelp," a generic human name, or <b>even a real company logo</b>, but don't be fooled.</p>

			Step 2: Consider The Content
		</div>

		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
		<ul>
			<li><p>Scams often create a sense of urgency to rush us into action. This fake urgency can come in the form of good news or bad news: limited-time offers, family emergencies, financial danger, information updates, and more. Take a moment to pause and consider the likelihood.</p></li>
		<p><li>Scammers will at some point ask for money or information.  This can be disguised as a needed "information update" or a bank transfer.   Sometimes criminals will even pose as companies or banks trying to <b>protect</b> us from scammers.  Call or check your official account before complying with any request.</li></p>
		<p><li>Scammers don't always graduate with A+ grades.  Look for misspellings, awkward language, typos, and style that doesn't match what you would expect from the supposed sender.</li></p>
			</ul>

			Step 3: Look For Suspicious Links
		</div>

		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
		<p>Scam emails include suspicious links to get you to visit <b>their</b> site.  Look for the same clues as in sender addresses: unofficial endings, misspellings, or implausibility. Would a large company like Netflix sent you to a page that's not an official part of their website?  Probably not.  Also look for links that include close misspellings of large companies, service providers, or banks.</p>
