			Step 1: Look At The Sender Address
		</div>

		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p>Look closely at the second part of the sender's email address, after the @. It may be misspelled or even nonsense. Legitimate organizations will never send from common email providers like @gmail.com (not even Google!). It may include convincing text like "payhelp," a generic human name, or <b>even a real company logo</b>, but don't be fooled.</p>

			Step 2: Consider The Content

		<div class="stepDescription">
		<br>
			Keep an eye out for any sense of urgency and requests for information or money.
			<ul>
			<li><p>Scams often create a sense of urgency to rush us into action. This fake urgency can come in the form of good news or bad news: limited-time offers, family emergencies, financial danger, information updates, and more. Take a moment to pause and consider the likelihood.</p></li>
		<p><li>Scammers will at some point ask for money or information.  This can be disguised as a needed "information update" or a bank transfer.   Sometimes criminals will even pose as companies or banks trying to <b>protect</b> us from scammers.  Call or check your official account before complying with any request.</li></p>

		<div class="stepTitle">
			Step 3: Consider The Style
		</div>

		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
		<p>	Scammers don't always graduate with A+ grades.  Look for misspellings, awkward language, typos, and style that doesn't match what you would expect from the supposed sender.
		<br>
				<br>
		Even an email from a trusted sender, like a friend, can be a scam if their  account was hacked. So consider whether they're asking for something unusual (especially gift or money-related) or if it seems like the correct tone.  If the message purports to be from a bank, the government, or a service provider, the style of the email should be formal and correct.

			Step 4: Look For Suspicious Links
		</div>

		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
		<p>Scam emails include suspicious links to get you to visit <b>their</b> site.  Look for the same clues as in sender addresses: unofficial endings, misspellings, or implausibility. Would a large company like Netflix sent you to a page that's not an official part of their website?  Probably not.  Also look for links that include close misspellings of large companies, service providers, or banks.</p>

		<div class="stepTitle">
			Step 5: Reach Out
		</div>

		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p>If you have any doubt about an email, <b>ignore it.</b></p>
			<br>
			That's right, ignore it and reach out to your bank, service provider, family, or friend directly.  Be sure to check online accounts through a new browser window or call published phone numbers, not usting information included in the email itself (if you do, you could be calling the scammer themself!).
			<br>
			Don't hesitate to get another set of trusted eyes on any message before moving ahead.
			<br>
			<br>
			Scammers want us to rush so we make mistakes.  Taking your time and an extra few minutes to verify could save you thousands.
