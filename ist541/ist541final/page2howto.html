		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p>Look closely at the second part of the sender's email address, after the @. It may be misspelled or even nonsense. Legitimate organizations will never send from common email providers like @gmail.com (not even Google!). It may include convincing text like "payhelp," a generic human name, or even the name of a real company, so don't be fooled.</p>
<p class="warning">

		Scam emails can include <strong>real company logos</strong> or <strong>personal information</strong>. Imposters can easily find official logos and true personal information on the internet.

			Keep an eye out for any sense of urgency and requests for information or money.
			<ul>
			<li><p>Scams often create a sense of urgency to rush us into action. This fake urgency can come in the form of good news or bad news: limited-time offers, family emergencies, financial danger, information updates, and more. Take a moment to pause and consider the likelihood.</p></li>
		<p><li>Scammers will at some point ask for money or information.  This can be disguised as a needed "information update" or a bank transfer.   Sometimes criminals will even pose as companies or banks trying to <b>protect</b> us from scammers.  Call or check your official account before complying with any request.</li></p>

    <summary class="stepTitle">Step 3: Consider The Style</summary>
		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
		<p>	Scammers don't always graduate with A+ grades.  Look for misspellings, awkward language, typos, and style that doesn't match what you would expect from the supposed sender.
		<br>
				<br>
		Even an email from a trusted sender, like a friend, can be a scam if their  account was hacked. So consider whether they're asking for something unusual (especially gift or money-related) or if it seems like the correct tone.  If the message purports to be from a bank, the government, or a service provider, the style of the email should be formal and correct.

    <summary class="stepTitle">Step 4: Look For Suspicious Links</summary>
		<div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
		<p>Scam emails include suspicious links to get you to visit <b>their</b> site.  Look for the same clues as in sender addresses: unofficial endings, misspellings, or implausibility. Would a large company like Netflix sent you to a page that's not an official part of their website?  Probably not.  Also look for links that include close misspellings of large companies, service providers, or banks.</p>

    <summary class="stepTitle">Step 5: Reach Out</summary>
		<div class="stepContent">
		<div class="stepDescription">
			<p>If you have any doubt about an email, <b>ignore it.</b></p>
			<br>
			That's right, ignore it and reach out to your bank, service provider, family, or friend directly.
			<br>
			Be sure to check online accounts through a new browser window or call published phone numbers, not usting information included in the email itself (if you do, you could be calling the scammer themself!).
			 Don't hesitate to get another set of trusted eyes on any message before moving ahead.
			<br>
			<br>
			Scammers want us to rush so we make mistakes.  Taking your time and an extra few minutes to verify could save you thousands.
